# TruckRoutingSystem
This project is done using asp.net mvc and localdatabase.
Users need to register and login to access the system.
Users can enter and delete their own truck model and create router. trucks and routers will be stored in the database.
I also tried to host it on azure, here is the URL: https://truckroutingsystem.azurewebsites.net/
//The database part doesn't work in azure yet.
